# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Kotlin. This project provides an interactive console-based game where two players take turns to mark Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features
- Two-player turn-based gameplay.
- Validates moves and prevents overwriting of existing marks.
- Detects win conditions and announces the winner.
- Handles draw conditions when no more moves are possible.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) installed on your system.
- An IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is recommended for editing and running the code.

### Running the Game
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LordNydorf/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
    cd tictactoe
    ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Kotlin-compatible IDE.

3. Run the main file (`Main.kt`) to start the game:
    - In IntelliJ IDEA, right-click on `Main.kt` and select "Run".

### Game Instructions
1. The game displays a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
2. Players take turns to input their move (row and column).
3. The first player is assigned 'X' and the second player 'O'.
4. The game ends when one player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or if the grid is filled without a winner (a draw).
